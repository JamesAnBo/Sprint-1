	It's a way to navigate your computer files and access, create or delete them using text commands instead of clicking around with your mouse. It also lets you directly control what you want your computer to do. It gives you more control if you know how to use it properly and know the right commands.

	7	rm <file> :this will delete a file.
	8	pwd :this will tell you the full path of the current folder you are looking at (like a "you are here" on a map).
